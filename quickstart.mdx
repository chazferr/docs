## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, or any Solana-compatible wallet)
- SOL for gas fees and trading

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Omnera">
    Go to [omnera.trade](https://omnera.trade) and click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Wallet">
    Choose your preferred Solana wallet from the list. We support Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve the Connection">
    Approve the connection request in your wallet. This allows Omnera to view your wallet address but never gives us access to your funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Fund Your Account

To start trading, you'll need SOL in your connected wallet. We recommend having at least 0.1 SOL for gas fees plus your trading capital.

<Warning>
  Never deposit more than you can afford to lose. Meme coin trading is extremely high risk.
</Warning>
