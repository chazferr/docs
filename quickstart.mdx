## What You Need

- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, etc.)
- SOL for trading

## Connect Your Wallet

  <Step title="Go to Omnera">
    Visit [omnera.trade](https://omnera.trade) and click **Connect Wallet**.

  <Step title="Select Your Wallet">
    Choose your Solana wallet. We support Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and more.

    Approve the connection in your wallet. Omnera can view your address but never access your funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Research a Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Token Intelligence">
    Click **Token Intelligence** or paste any token address in the search bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Brief">
    In ~3 seconds, you'll see:

    - Creator wallet history
    - Holder distribution
    - Social signals
    - AI risk summary
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask the AI">
    Token Intelligence is conversational. Ask things like:
    - *"Is this safe to trade?"*
    - *"What's the biggest red flag?"*
    - *"Show me similar tokens"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Make a Trade

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Your Trade">
    Specify how much SOL you want to swap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Check the expected output and price impact.
  </Step>
