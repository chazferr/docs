## The Problem With Cross-Chain Today

You want to buy a token on Base using SOL. Here's what that looks like:

1. Find a bridge
2. Hope it's not compromised
3. Wait for the bridge transaction
4. Get wrapped tokens you didn't want
5. Swap wrapped tokens for native
6. Finally make your trade
7. Pay fees at every step

**30+ minutes, multiple transactions, and you're still not sure if you got a good rate.**

## Omnera Warp: Just Say What You Want

With Warp, you express your intent:

> *"Buy $500 of TOKEN on Base using my SOL"*

Warp handles everything else. One signature. No bridges. No wrapped tokens. No complexity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Express Your Intent">
    *"Swap 10 SOL for ETH on Ethereum"* or *"Buy TOKEN on Arbitrum using USDC on Solana"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Warp Finds the Path">
    Our solver network competes to find you the best execution across all available routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="One Signature">
    Sign once on Solana. That's it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Your intent executes atomically. Either it all happens, or none of it does. No stuck funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Chains (Planned)

| Chain | Launch Status |
|-------|---------------|
| Solana | Primary chain |
| Ethereum | At launch |
| Base | At launch |
| Arbitrum | At launch |
| More L2s | Post-launch |

## Why This Matters

### For Traders

- **Access any opportunity** — Don't miss a trade because your funds are on the wrong chain
- **One interface** — Trade across chains from Omnera without juggling apps
- **Better rates** — Solver competition means you get optimal execution

### No More Bridge Risk

Bridges have lost billions to hacks. Warp's architecture eliminates the traditional bridge attack surface. Your assets move through execution, not custody.

## Example Intents

```
"Swap all my SOL for ETH on Ethereum"
→ Warp finds best rate, executes atomically

"Buy 1000 USDC worth of DEGEN on Base"
→ SOL → execution → DEGEN, one signature

"Move my portfolio to Arbitrum"
→ All assets converted and transferred optimally
```

## Technical Architecture

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solver Network" icon="network-wired">
    Decentralized solvers compete to fill your intent. Competition = better rates for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Atomic Execution" icon="atom">
    Intents either fully complete or fully revert. No partial fills, no stuck funds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Custody" icon="key">
    Warp never holds your assets. Execution happens through smart contracts, not custody.
