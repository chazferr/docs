## Overview

Omnera Warp is our intent-based cross-chain protocol that enables seamless trading across multiple blockchains. Express what you want to do, and Warp handles the complexity of cross-chain execution.

<Info>
  **Target Launch**: Q2-Q3 2026
</Info>

## The Problem

Cross-chain trading today is fragmented and complex:

- Multiple bridges with different trust assumptions
- Gas tokens needed on every chain
- Failed transactions and stuck funds
- MEV extraction during bridging

## The Warp Solution

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Intent-Based" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Express your desired outcome, not the execution path. Warp finds the optimal route.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Single Signature" icon="signature">
    One transaction on your source chain executes the entire cross-chain operation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MEV Protected" icon="shield">
    Private Execution technology extended to cross-chain trades.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Bridging Required" icon="bridge">
    Trade directly without manually bridging assets first.
  </Card>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Express Intent">
    Specify what you want: "Swap 1 SOL for ETH on Ethereum" or "Buy TOKEN on Base using USDC on Solana"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route Discovery">
    Warp's solver network finds the optimal execution path across chains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Single Transaction">
    Sign one transaction on Solana. Warp handles everything else.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guaranteed Execution">
    Either your entire intent executes successfully, or nothing happens. No stuck funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Chains (Planned)

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Solana | Primary (Launch) |
| Ethereum | Launch |
| Base | Launch |
| Arbitrum | Launch |
| Additional L2s | Post-launch |

## Intent Examples

```
Intent: Swap 10 SOL for maximum ETH on Ethereum
Result: Warp finds the best rate across all available paths

Intent: Buy 1000 USDC of TOKEN on Base using SOL
Result: SOL → USDC → Bridge → TOKEN, all in one signature

Intent: Move my portfolio from Ethereum to Solana
Result: All assets converted and bridged optimally
```
