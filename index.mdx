The infrastructure for on-chain trading has evolved rapidly, but one critical gap remains: traders still execute blind. They research too slowly, test strategies with real capital, and lose value to MEV extraction on nearly every trade. The tools exist to swap tokens. The tools to trade intelligently do not.

Omnera is engineered to close this gap. We deliver real-time token intelligence that learns your trading patterns over time, surfacing opportunities that match your edge. Our AI Backtester validates strategies against real historical data, including failed tokens, so you know if your edge is real before deploying capital. Every trade routes through MEV-protected infrastructure, ensuring the price you see is the price you get.

We're building toward a chain-abstracted future. Omnera Warp will enable intent-based cross-chain execution, allowing you to trade across Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum from one interface, with one signature. No bridges. No wrapped tokens. No complexity.

One platform. Smarter research. Protected execution.
