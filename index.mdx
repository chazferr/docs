Omnera is the AI-powered trading terminal built for serious Solana traders. We provide clarity before execution — combining real-time token intelligence, strategy validation, and MEV-protected execution in a single, mobile-first platform.

The core problem in on-chain trading isn't access to markets — it's access to information. Traders lose money not because they can't execute, but because they execute without context. They research too slowly, test strategies with real capital, and lose value to MEV extraction on every trade.

Omnera solves this. Token Intelligence delivers comprehensive token analysis in under three seconds, learning your trading patterns over time to surface opportunities that match your edge. The AI Backtester validates strategies against real historical data — including failed tokens — so you know if your edge is real before deploying capital. Private Execution routes every trade through MEV-protected infrastructure, ensuring the price you see is the price you get.

We're building toward a chain-abstracted future. Omnera Warp will enable intent-based cross-chain execution — trade across Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum from one interface, with one signature. No bridges. No wrapped tokens. No complexity.

One platform. Smarter research. Protected execution.
