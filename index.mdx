## What is Omnera?

Omnera is the AI-powered, chain-abstracted trading terminal. We give traders clarity before execution through Token Intelligence that learns your trading style, a Backtester that validates strategies against real historical data, and private execution that protects every trade from MEV.

**Coming soon**: Intent-based cross-chain execution that lets you trade across blockchains without bridges — one wallet, any chain.

One platform. Smarter research. Faster execution. Completely mobile-first.
