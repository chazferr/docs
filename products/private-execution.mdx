## Overview

Private Execution is Omnera's MEV protection layer that shields your trades from sandwich attacks, front-running, and other forms of value extraction. When you trade with Private Execution enabled, your transactions are routed through protected channels to ensure you get the price you expect.

<Info>
  MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) costs Solana traders millions in value extraction every month. Private Execution helps you keep more of your profits.

## What is MEV?

MEV refers to the profit that can be extracted from users by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. Common MEV attacks include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sandwich Attacks" icon="burger">
    Bots detect your pending trade and place orders before and after yours, profiting from the price impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Front-Running" icon="person-running">
    Bots copy your trade and execute it before you, taking the opportunity you identified.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Back-Running" icon="arrow-right">
    Bots place trades immediately after yours to capture arbitrage opportunities you created.
  </Card>
  <Card title="JIT Liquidity" icon="clock">
    Just-in-time liquidity that extracts value from your swap through precise timing.
  </Card>

## How Private Execution Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Submission">
    When you submit a trade with Private Execution enabled, your transaction is encrypted and sent to our protected mempool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Private Routing">
    Your transaction is routed directly to block builders who commit to not extracting MEV from protected transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Your trade executes at the expected price without interference from MEV bots.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You receive confirmation with the actual execution price matching your quoted price.
  </Step>
</Steps>
