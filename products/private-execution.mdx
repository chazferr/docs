## The Problem

You find a great entry. You submit your trade. But before it executes:

1. A bot sees your pending transaction
2. It buys before you, pushing the price up
3. Your trade executes at a worse price
4. The bot sells into your buy

**You just got sandwiched.** The bot made money. You paid for it.

This happens constantly on Solana. MEV bots extract millions from traders every month — and most traders don't even realize it's happening.

## The Solution

Every trade routed through Omnera is MEV-protected.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Submit a Trade">
    Buy or sell through Omnera's interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Private Routing">
    Your transaction is encrypted and sent directly to validators who commit to not extracting MEV.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protected Execution">
    Your trade executes without bots seeing it in the public mempool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Keep the Value">
    No sandwich. No front-run. The price you saw is the price you got.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Always On

Private Execution is enabled by default on all Omnera trades. You don't need to toggle anything or pay extra. Every swap, every trade — protected.

## The Invisible Tax

Most traders don't realize how much they lose to MEV:

| Trade Size | Typical MEV Loss | Per Month (20 trades) |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1 SOL | 0.5-2% | 0.1-0.4 SOL |
| 5 SOL | 1-3% | 1-3 SOL |
| 10+ SOL | 2-5% | 4-10 SOL |

<Info>
  Larger trades attract more MEV attention. The bots know a 10 SOL buy will move price more than a 1 SOL buy — so they front-run it harder.

These percentages add up. Over a month of active trading, MEV can eat a significant portion of your profits — or turn winning strategies into losing ones.

## What MEV Looks Like

### Sandwich Attack

A sandwich attack wraps your trade between two bot transactions to extract value:

1. You submit a buy order to the mempool
2. Bot sees your pending transaction
3. Bot buys the token first, pushing the price up
4. Your trade executes at the higher price
5. Bot sells into your buy, profiting from the spread
6. You overpaid — the bot extracted value from your trade

### Front-Running

Front-running is when a bot copies your trade and executes it before you:

1. You submit a buy order for a promising token
2. Bot sees your transaction in the mempool
3. Bot copies your trade and executes it first
4. The price moves against you
5. Your trade either fails or executes at a worse price
6. The bot captured your alpha

## How Private Execution Protects You

With Omnera, your transaction never enters the public mempool where bots can see it:

1. You submit your trade through Omnera
2. Your transaction is encrypted
3. It's sent directly to protected validators via private channels
4. Bots never see your transaction
5. Your trade executes at the expected price
6. No MEV extracted — you keep the value

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there additional cost?" icon="coins">
    No. Private Execution is included in standard Omnera trading fees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is it slower?" icon="clock">
    Negligible difference — typically 50-100ms additional latency. Unnoticeable in practice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does it work for all tokens?" icon="list-check">
    Yes. Any Solana token traded through Omnera gets MEV protection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disable it?" icon="toggle-off">
    Yes, though we don't recommend it. Some traders want raw mempool access for specific strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know it's working?" icon="shield-check">
    Protected trades show a shield icon in your transaction history. You can compare your execution price to the market price at time of submission.

## The Bottom Line

You find the trades. You take the risk. You should keep the profits.

Private Execution ensures the value you create stays with you — not with bots that contribute nothing except extraction.
