## The Problem

You find a token. Now what?

Open DEXScreener. Check the contract on RugCheck. Look up the creator wallet. Scan holder distribution. Check Twitter. Look at Telegram. Maybe cross reference with similar tokens that pumped or failed.

**60-180 seconds later**, you've got 6+ tabs open and the opportunity has moved. Or worse, you entered a position without proper context.

## AI That Learns How YOU Trade

Here's where it gets powerful.

Token Intelligence doesn't just analyze tokens. It learns how you trade.

<Steps>
  <Step title="It Watches Your Patterns">
    Every trade you make teaches the AI about your style. What market caps do you prefer? What holder distributions? What social signals matter to you?
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Identifies Your Edge">
    Ask the AI: *"What do I trade best?"* It tells you. Perhaps you perform best on low cap launches with strong social presence. Perhaps you're more effective with established tokens and locked liquidity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Surfaces Opportunities">
    Over time, Token Intelligence personalizes to YOUR winning patterns, not generic signals. It highlights tokens that match what actually works for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Compounds">
    The more you trade, the smarter it gets. This is compounding AI that works for you, not against you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to Use Token Intelligence

### Quick Search

1. Paste any Solana token address or search by name
2. Get your complete analysis in ~3 seconds
3. Make informed decisions, not emotional ones

### Ask the AI

Token Intelligence isn't just a dashboard. It's conversational. Ask questions like:

- *"Is this token safe to trade?"*
- *"What do I trade best?"*
- *"Show me tokens similar to ones I've profited on"*
- *"What's concerning about this contract?"*
