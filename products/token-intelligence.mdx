## The Problem

You find a token. Now what?

Open DEXScreener. Check the contract on RugCheck. Look up the creator wallet. Scan holder distribution. Check Twitter. Look at Telegram. Maybe cross-reference with similar tokens that pumped or rugged.

**60-180 seconds later**, you've got 6+ tabs open and the token already moved. Or worse — you FOMO'd in with zero context and got burned.

## AI That Learns How YOU Trade

Here's where it gets powerful.

Token Intelligence doesn't just analyze tokens — **it learns how you trade.**

<Frame>
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Trading Loop"
        A[You Trade] --> B[AI Observes]
        B --> C[Patterns Identified]
        C --> D[Personalized Insights]
        D --> E[Better Opportunities]
        E --> A
    end

    style A fill:#3D39A7,color:#fff
    style B fill:#151236,color:#fff
    style C fill:#151236,color:#fff
    style D fill:#151236,color:#fff
    style E fill:#3D39A7,color:#fff
```
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="It Watches Your Patterns">
    Every trade you make teaches the AI about your style. What market caps do you prefer? What holder distributions? What social signals matter to you?
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Identifies Your Edge">
    Ask the AI: *"What do I trade best?"* It tells you. Maybe you crush low-cap launches with strong Twitter presence. Maybe you're better at established tokens with locked liquidity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Surfaces Opportunities">
    Over time, Token Intelligence personalizes to YOUR winning patterns — not generic signals. It highlights tokens that match what actually works for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="It Compounds">
    The more you trade, the smarter it gets. This is compounding AI that works for you, not against you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to Use Token Intelligence

### Quick Search

1. Paste any Solana token address or search by name
2. Get your complete analysis in ~3 seconds
3. Make informed decisions, not emotional ones

### Ask the AI

Token Intelligence isn't just a dashboard — it's conversational. Ask questions like:

- *"Is this token safe to trade?"*
- *"What do I trade best?"*
- *"Show me tokens similar to ones I've profited on"*
- *"What's concerning about this contract?"*
