## The Problem

You think you have a strategy. Maybe it's:
- "Buy tokens under $100K market cap with locked liquidity"
- "Enter when holder count crosses 500"
- "Sell at 2x, cut losses at 50%"

But does it actually work? You won't know until you've lost real money finding out.

## The Solution

Run your exact filters and rules against **real Solana data** from the last 7-30 days. Not cleaned-up data. Not survivorship-biased data. Real data, with realistic slippage, failed tokens included, and all the chaos of actual markets.

<Info>
  Most backtesting tools quietly remove failed tokens from their data. Omnera includes them, because you would have traded them too.
</Info>

## AI That Speaks Plain English

The AI Backtester doesn't just give you numbers. It tells you what they mean.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Honest Assessment" icon="comments">
    *"This strategy lost 14 trades in a row at one point. Could you handle that?"*
  </Card>
  <Card title="What Broke" icon="magnifying-glass">
    *"Your biggest losses came from tokens with unlocked liquidity. Consider adding that filter."*
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suggested Fixes" icon="wrench">
    *"Adding a minimum holder count of 200 would have avoided 60% of your losing trades."*
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reality Check" icon="scale-balanced">
    *"This strategy has edge, but requires $5K minimum to survive the drawdowns."*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Gets Tested

### Your Exact Rules

Define your strategy however you trade:

```
Entry Conditions:
- Market cap between $50K and $500K
- Liquidity locked for 30+ days
- Top 10 holders own less than 40%
- At least 100 holders
- Creator wallet has 2+ previous tokens

Exit Conditions:
- Take profit at 2x
- Stop loss at -40%
- Time-based exit after 4 hours if flat
```

### Against Real Conditions

| What's Included | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Realistic slippage | Your backtested entry price matches what you'd actually get |
| Failed transactions | Some trades wouldn't have executed. We account for that |
| Failed tokens | Tokens that went to zero are in the data |
| Gas costs | Priority fees during congestion are included |
| Timing | Execution delays based on actual network conditions |

## How to Use the Backtester

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Strategy">
    Set your entry conditions, exit rules, and position sizing. Be specific. The more precise your rules, the more accurate your backtest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Period">
    - **7 days**: Quick validation, recent market conditions
    - **14 days**: Balanced view across different market states
    - **30 days**: Comprehensive test including various market cycles
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Backtest">
    Omnera simulates every trade your strategy would have made, with realistic execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review with the AI">
    Don't just look at the numbers. Ask the AI:
    - *"What killed my best trades?"*
    - *"How do I reduce drawdowns?"*
    - *"Is this edge real or just luck?"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine and Repeat">
    Adjust your strategy based on the AI's feedback. Run again. Find real edge, or save yourself from a strategy that was destined to fail.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | What's Good |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Win Rate | % of profitable trades | Depends on R:R, but >35% with good sizing |
| Average R | Avg win ÷ avg loss | Above 2.0 means winners outpace losers |
| Max Drawdown | Worst peak-to-trough decline | Under 30% for most traders |
| Max Losing Streak | Most consecutive losses | Can you emotionally handle this? |
| Expectancy | Average $ per trade | Positive = you have edge |

### The Questions That Matter

The AI helps you answer what backtests alone can't:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can you handle the drawdowns?" icon="heart-pulse">
    A strategy might be profitable but require stomach-churning losing streaks. The AI tells you upfront.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the edge statistically significant?" icon="chart-simple">
    10 winning trades could be luck. The AI assesses whether your sample size supports real conclusions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What market conditions does this need?" icon="cloud-sun">
    Some strategies only work in specific conditions. The AI identifies dependencies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much capital do you need?" icon="sack-dollar">
    Based on drawdowns and position sizing, the AI calculates minimum viable capital.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## No Survivorship Bias

<Warning>
  Most backtesting data quietly removes failed tokens. This makes strategies look better than they are. Omnera includes all tokens, including those that went to zero, because when you're trading live, you don't get to skip them.
</Warning>

When a token failed during your backtest period, it's in there. When liquidity was pulled, it's in there. The results you see are the results you would have actually gotten.

## Find Edge or Save Money

The AI Backtester does one of two things:

1. **Validates your edge.** You have a real strategy. Now you can trade it with confidence.
2. **Saves you from yourself.** The strategy doesn't work. Better to find out here than with real money.

Either outcome is a win.
